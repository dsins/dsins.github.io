   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install openai
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Locate your Azure OpenAI key by going to [https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) and search for `Open AI` and select the `Open AI resource` and then select `Keys and Endpoint` and copy the `Key 1` value.

1. Create an _app.py_ file and give it the following code:

   ```python
   import openai

   openai.api_key = "<replace this value with your open ai key or Azure OpenAI key>"

   openai.api_type = 'azure'
   openai.api_version = '2023-05-15'
   openai.api_base = "<endpoint found in Azure Portal where your API key is>"
   deployment_name = "<deployment name>"

   # add your completion code
   prompt = "Complete the following: Once upon a time there was a"
   messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]

   # make completion
   completion = openai.chat.completions.create(model=deployment_name, messages=messages)

   # print response
   print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
   ```
